## Welcome to story's simple instruction

Please proceed with the following step for the App test:

1. Pls unzip the **story.zip**
2. Go to the following github page in your xcode simulator https://github.com/yunartoalbert/story/blob/master/README.md
3. Proceed by clicking the following link: https://e23qt.app.link/YmW2zI1q5Y without the project running. You should be redirected to this page. This shows the fallback to the webpage through Branch
4. Now run the attached story file (pls open **xcworkspace**). Run the product to view the single view app. 
5. Open back this page (https://github.com/yunartoalbert/story/blob/master/README.md) and click on the link on **step 2**
6. You will open the app directly, since Universal Link is not setup you will see the notification before redirected to the app.


For the website test:
1. Pls unzip the **story web.zip**
2. Email me to the path of the file, I will send you **the link to activate the smart banner**
3. Go to your web browser (preferably chrome) **right click > inspect > Toggle Device Toolbar** and then **choose any of the Iphone devices**
4. Paste the url sent to your email and go to the webpage.
5. Smart banner should appear below, as the app is not registered in App Store you should go back to this github page.
